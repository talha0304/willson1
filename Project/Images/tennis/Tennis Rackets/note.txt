1.Babolat adds another chapter to the game's most iconic modern player's racket. As with previous versions of the Pure Drive, this update keeps the same easy learning curve and explosive spec profile that has attracted generations of players.

Updated with Babolat's new HTR System, the Pure Drive's graphite layup has been reengineered for higher torsional rigidity, resulting in more efficient energy transfer to the ball. To help with vibration dampening, Babolat has devoted more space in the shaft to SWX Pure Feel, a thin and extremely flexible viscoelastic rubber that sits between the racquet's carbon layers.

Additional features include FSI Power Technology, which optimizes the grommet system and string spacing for higher levels of power and spin.

On court, this racket's explosive acceleration and spin-friendly targeting make it a dangerous weapon from the baseline. It also packs impressive all-court mobility, making it great for cranking winners on the run or charging into the front court and finishing points at net.

With incremental tweaks to the feel, this update won't disappoint especially if you place a premium on quick handling. The Pure Drive continues to be one of the best options for those who want a light and explosive player's racket.
